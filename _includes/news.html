        I published my first Medium article, titled at <a href="https://medium.com/p/edae26e59b3f">"The Hidden Bias in AI’s ‘Productivity’ & ‘Qualification’ Metrics: Why We Need to Broaden Our Horizons"</a>. It is based on my 8+ years of post-undergrad experience in the fields of engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. I decided to talk about this Hidden Bias, which actually is not hidden, rather it is Not UN-hidden, in a sense. It is a 10 mins read, so please let me know what you think of it, and whether you have experienced the same or not.
