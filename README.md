# Academic personal page based on Jekyll-Now and Bootstrap

## Usage

Fork this repository edit the `_config.yml` as described in [Jekyll-Now docs](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md#quick-start), edit the bio section in `index.html` with your details, rename the repository to `your_username.github.io` and make it public. Your website should be up and running.

Upload your portrait picture to `images` and use `_make_favicon.sh` to create the favicon.

To add a publication, create a new file in `publications/_posts/` directory, place the related illustration in `publications/images`, and run `_make_thumbnails.sh` to create standardised thumbnail images.

## Attributions

The website design is inspired by [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/) and the initial Jekyll-Now fork was done by [Leonid Keselman](https://github.com/leonidk/new_website). I have redesigned this website with Bootstrap to be more mobile-friendly and accessible.

Feel free to use this template, with or without changes, to your own needs.
